        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a Unity-based teleportation platformer designed around timing, spatial awareness, and
            fast-paced decision-making. The player jumps between dynamically generated floating platforms using a unique
            teleport mechanic. Two modes are included: Infinite Mode, which challenges players to survive as long as
            possible, and Timed Mode, which focuses on scoring efficiently within a 60-second limit. The game showcases
            Unity techniques including procedural object spawning, player physics, C# scripting, UI management,
            persistent high score storage, and scene transitions. This webpage includes major screenshots, gameplay
            explanations, our development team profiles, a video demonstration, and a downloadable build of the
            application. This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in game development, teamwork, and gameplay
            design with an emphasis on responsiveness and replayability.
